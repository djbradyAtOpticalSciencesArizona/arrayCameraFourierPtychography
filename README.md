### Photon-limited bounds for phase retrieval
The optimal Cram√©r-Rao lower bound on the mean-square error for the estimation of a coherent signal from photon-limited intensity measurements is equal to the number of signal elements, or the number of signal elements minus one when we account for the unobservable reference phase. Whereas this bound is attained by phase-quadrature holography, we also show that it can be attained through a phase-retrieval system that does not require a coherent reference. 

***Fourier_Ptychography_for_Phase_Retrieval.ipynb*** : We implemented a Fourier ptychographic system where sampling windows were applied to the signal in the Fourier space, and the selected patches were inverse transformed to generate low-resolution frames.
